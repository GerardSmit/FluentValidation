# GerardSmit.FluentValidation

This is a fork of the [FluentValidation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation) with changes that makes my life a little bit easier ðŸ™‚

1. Added basic LINQ support (`Select`, `Where`) for `IRuleBuilder<T, TProperty>` to filter and transform validation rules without having to make a `When`-clause for every rule.
  
   For example, I use `Optional<T>` type in my API responses, and I wanted to validate the properties of the `Optional<T>` type without constantly checking if the value is present.  
   Before:  
   ```csharp
   v.When(x => x.Name.HasValue, () => v.RuleFor(x => x.Name.Value).NotEmpty());
   ```

    After with a extension method:
    ```csharp
    v.RuleForOptional(x => x.Name).NotEmpty();

    // Extension
    internal static class OptionalExtensions
    {
      public static IRuleBuilder<T, TProperty> RuleForOptional<T, TProperty>(
        this AbstractValidator<T> validator,
        Expression<Func<T, Optional<TProperty>>> expression
      )
      {
        return validator.RuleFor(expression)
          .Where(x => x.HasValue)
          .Select(
            (_, v) => v.Value,
            (_, v) => new Optional<TProperty>(v)
          );
      }
    }
    ```

2. Added non-generic interfaces, so I can get values I want without using reflection.

Below is the original README from the FluentValidation project, which contains more information about the library.

### Example
```csharp
using FluentValidation;

public class CustomerValidator: AbstractValidator<Customer> {
  public CustomerValidator() {
    RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotEmpty();
    RuleFor(x => x.Forename).NotEmpty().WithMessage("Please specify a first name");
    RuleFor(x => x.Discount).NotEqual(0).When(x => x.HasDiscount);
    RuleFor(x => x.Address).Length(20, 250);
    RuleFor(x => x.Postcode).Must(BeAValidPostcode).WithMessage("Please specify a valid postcode");
  }

  private bool BeAValidPostcode(string postcode) {
    // custom postcode validating logic goes here
  }
}

var customer = new Customer();
var validator = new CustomerValidator();

// Execute the validator
ValidationResult results = validator.Validate(customer);

// Inspect any validation failures.
bool success = results.IsValid;
List<ValidationFailure> failures = results.Errors;
```
